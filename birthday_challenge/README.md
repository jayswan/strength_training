# Birthday Challenge

For many years my brother and I have been doing "birthday challenge" workouts where you do something oriented around your age in years. You can do fractions or multiples too.

## 2020
This year my challenge was: in 52 hours, perform:
- at least 5200 vertical feet of human powered climb
- at least 52,000 pounds of weight moved during strength training

I ended up finishing in about 37 hours with some extra climbing. See the CSV above for details. The strength training was spread out over several sessions; I list total reps per exercise/weight only, not individual sets. I picked things that I am good at, and generally did a lot of variations with relatively low weight so that I would still have energy for the climbing workouts.
