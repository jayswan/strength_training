# Winter 2022 Bench Program
This is the program I used to hit a lifetime bench PR at age 53. Note: I am not a powerlifter and I am not naturally good at bench press; my numbers are not impressive but I feel like hitting a lifetime PR at my age is pretty good anyway.

This program was based on [this article on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/rkmv1r/overtrained_50_consecutive_days_of_benching/). I knew from experience that I would need at least one day off, so I couldn't follow it exactly.

I use every regular bench rep as an opportunity to practice form: scapular retraction, tight lats, full body tightness, leg drive, etc. I bench with a narrow grip and no arch, because of mobility limitations. If I could arch or grip wider, I would.

## Warm Up (6 days a week)
- 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, 15 squats
  - Minimum: 1 set at bodyweight, 5 sets with a 22 pound weight vest. Sometimes more.
- Bench warm up: whatever you need, but nothing higher than 4-5 easy reps per set.

## Basic Format
- Start with a max you have actually done for 1 strict rep in the last two months.
- Bench press 4 total reps in any set/rep scheme at 85%, 6 days a week. When it starts to feel easy for a whole week, add 5 pounds. 
- Bench 1 rep at 95% or higher, once a week. When you get a new 1 RM, recalculate your numbers.
- Every other workout, do 30-40 total assistance exercise reps in sets of 8-10 at about RPE 6-7 (exception: floor press; see below).
- I recommend getting some [fractional plates](https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-lb-fractional-plates) so you can bump your numbers on your 95+% day in sub-5-pound increments.
- Do other body parts as you see fit.
- Do low-intensity cardio.
- Eat a lot of carbs.

## Schedule
- Sunday: warm up, bench 4 x 85%, grip work. Bike ride.
- Monday: warm up, bench 4 x 85%, incline bench assistance. DB rows. Lower body choice.
- Tuesday: warm up, bench 4 x 85%, lower body choice.
- Wednesday: warm up, bench 4 x 85%, DB floor press assistance (1 set MAX weight RPE 10 for 8-10 reps, others at weight for RPE 6-7). Lower body choice, run, or bike.
- Thursday: warm up, bench 4 x 85%.
- Friday: Long easy run. No weights.
- Saturday: warm up, work up to 1 x 95% or higher. 4 x 85% Larsen press assistance. Lower body choice, run, or bike.

## Lower body choice
- Land mine belt squats, easy weight, 4-5 sets of 10-15.
- Work up to a few doubles or triples in deadlift at 75-85%. Nothing crazy.
- Work up to a near-max double or triple with fat grip deadlift (this will be substantially less weight than regular bar DLs, but will wreck your grip).
- One-hand DB deadlifts, high pulls, or snatches with a fat grip DB.
- Weight vest lunges.

## Notes
I am better at reps than maxes, so my rep weight quickly got out of whack with my percentages. The numbers say that my max should be about 10 pounds higher than it is, but my rep days are feeling easy enough that they go up much faster than my heavy days. I'm not sure what to make of this, but I'll take it.
