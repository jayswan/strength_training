# Strength Training

A friend asked me to write up some basic notes on my current strength training routines.

This is informed by the fact that I train at home, with a small but versatile range of equipment. I am reasonably fit, in my late 40s, and my priorities are to preserve strength while minimizing injury risk.

I train every weekday for about 20-30 minutes. There's nothing magic about this; your frequency and volume of training can and should change at various points in your life. In general, I have found that frequent, short periods of strength training work well for me, but you might be different.

The most important thing in physical training is consistency. It doesn't matter that much what you do, as long as you do it consistently over a long period of time, work reasonably hard, and avoid injuries.

I am not saying you should do this, or that I am strong or weak, or that this is good or bad, or better than workout X. It's just what I do and has worked reasonably well for me a long period of time.

I also do trail running and cycling (mostly mountain biking) regularly.

For examples see [EXAMPLES.md](examples.md).

## Format
I pick one or two "main" exercises and one or two "extra" exercises (see below), then I target a total number of reps for the main exercises. On a "heavier" day the total number might be in the 15-50 range. On a lighter day the total number might be 50-150 or more. I don't have any scientific method of partitioning the sets and reps other than how I feel, what else I'm doing that day, etc. I might do 8 sets of 8 reps, or 5 sets of 4 reps, or 5 sets of 25 reps. Rest periods vary, but are almost always 90 seconds or less.

Whatever I'm doing, I try to fit it into 20-30 minutes total. If I train longer than that, the recovery tends to interfere with running and cycling, which I also enjoy. You might be different.

If there's time, I finish with one or two extra exercises.

## Main Exercises
I do the same set of basic exercises year-round, but I vary the sets, weights, and reps frequently.

- Pull-ups
  - Weighted
    - I use either a weight vest or a length of webbing hitched around a dumbbell or kettlebell to add weight.
  - Bodyweight
  - I use a door mounted pull-up bar. I do mostly palms-away, shoulder-width pull-ups but I vary grips and widths sometimes.
  - I do not do kipping pull-ups.
  - I do not hyperextend either my elbow or shoulder joints when doing pull-ups; I keep a little tension in both at the end of the range of motion.
  - To improve single-set pull-up count (e.g., for a physical fitness test requirement), do 5 sets of max reps with a 90 second rest, 3-4 days a week.
  - Otherwise, don't worry too much about single-set counts for the first year or so. Focus on the total number of reps in X number of minutes, regardless of set/rep/rest counts. For example, try to get to 10 reps in 10 minutes, 20 reps in 5 minutes, or whatever.
  - If you need assistance, use a resistance band looped around the bar instead of a machine.

- Push-ups
  - Weighted
    - Because I don't have a bench, this is my primary upper body pressing exercise. I do them mostly with a 25 or 35 pound plate on my back, but sometimes I use a weight vest.
  - Unweighted

- Overhead Press
  - Barbell, dumbbell, kettlebell
  - Strict or push press.

- Power Cleans
  - Form is very important to avoid injury.
    - For this reason I err on the side of lighter weight, and I don't do more than 5 reps per set.
  - I usually shoot for about 20-25 total reps in a workout, but the weight, sets, and reps vary a lot.
  - I often do power-cleans into an overhead press or push-press.

- Goblet Squats
  - Dumbbell or kettlebell

- Air Squats
  - Bodyweight or with a weight vest.

## Extra Exercises
I usually throw in one or two of these in any given workout, for a few sets of whatever feels good.

- Walking Lunges
- Ball slams with a non-bouncing medicine ball
- Dumbbell side raises
- Curls
- Kettlebell swings
- Sit ups
- Planks
- Dumbbell rows

## Questions
- Why don't you do heavy squats, deadlifts, etc?
  - I am also doing a fair amount of running and cycling. I find that I can recover from the air squats, goblet squats, lunges, and power cleans and still be able to run and ride. If I do heavy squats and deads I don't recover fast enough. It might be different for you.
- What supplements do you take?
  - The only supplement I take right now is Onnit krill oil.
